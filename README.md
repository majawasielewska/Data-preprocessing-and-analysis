# Data-preprocessing-and-analysis-R

The aim of the project was to prepare a dataset and its statistical analysis along with visualization in the R programming language.

The dataset (catsvsdogs.xlsx) covers the population and ownership of dogs and cats by household by state through the American Veterinary Medical Association.

For the purposes of the project, a categorical variable was added that represents the presence/absence of more than 50 percent of children in the household.
